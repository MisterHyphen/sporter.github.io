            <h1>Mistborn</h1>
            <p>Mistborn is one of my favorite book series. One of the three magic systems in the series is called allomancy. It allows specific people, who are born the ability, to consume a specific metal to gain an ability or power.</p>

            <h2>Allomancy</h2>
            <p>There are a total of sixteen normal metals and some unknown number of more powerful god metals. Each of the 16 normal metals is either physical, mental, enhancement, or temporal based on the ability that it gives. In addition, each metal is one of the following: external, pulling; external, pushing; internal, pulling; or internal, pushing. An external metal affects the world around you, while an internal metal typically affects your mind or body. A pulling metal allows you to pull on something, while a pushing metal allows you to push on something.</p>

            <h2>What Do the Metals Do?</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Iron</dt>
                <dd>Iron allows the user to pull on metal around them. If the user weighs more than the object, it will be pulled to them; if the user weighs less than the object, they will be pulled toward it. It also allows the user to see nearby sources of metal.</dd>
                <dt>Steel</dt>
                <dd>Steel allows the user to push on metal around them. If the user weighs more than the object, it will be pushed away from them; if the user weighs less than the object, they will be pushed away from it. It also allows the user to see nearby sources of metal.</dd>
                <dt>Tin</dt>
                <dd>Tin increases the sensitivity of the user&apos;s five senses. They all get increased sensitivity at the same time; they cannot gain increased sensitivity individually.</dd>
                <dt>Pewter</dt>
                <dd>Pewter increases the capabilities of the user&apos;s body. It also helps the body heal faster.</dd>
                <dt>Zinc</dt>
                <dd>Zinc riots or strengthens the emotions of another person or several people at the same time. It can affect just one emotion or many.</dd>
                <dt>Brass</dt>
                <dd>Brass soothes or weakens the emotions of another person or several people at the same time. It can affect just one emotion or many.</dd>
                <dt>Copper</dt>
                <dd>Copper protects the user&apos;s emotions from being influenced by alomancy. Copper also creates an area around the user where allomancy cannot be detected.</dd>
                <dt>Bronze</dt>
                <dd>Bronze allows the user to detect nearby people using allomancy; if someone is using allomancy, you will be able to hear a pulsing sound. The user can also tell what metal or metals are being used based on the sound.</dd>
                <dt>Aluminum</dt>
                <dd>Aluminum allows the user to clear all stored allomantic metals in their body.</dd>
                <dt>Duralumin</dt>
                <dd>Duralumin causes any other metals currently being used to instantly be consumed. When these other metals are consumed, the ability of that metal is the same, but it just gives one strong burst.</dd>
                <dt>Chromium</dt>
                <dd>Chromium allows the user to gain an ability like that of aluminum. It allows the user to clear all stored allomantic metals in the body of anyone they are touching.</dd>
                <dt>Nicrosil</dt>
                <dd>Nicrosil allows the user to gain an ability like that of duralumin. It causes any other metals currently being used by a person you are touching to instantly be consumed. When these other metals are consumed, the ability of that metal is the same, but it just gives one strong burst.</dd>
                <dt>Gold</dt>
                <dd>Gold allows the user to see other possible paths that they could have taken throughout their life and what their life could have been like if they took that path.</dd>
                <dt>Electrum</dt>
                <dd>Electrum allows the user to see possible decisions they could make and paths they could take in the future.</dd>
                <dt>Cadmium</dt>
                <dd>Cadmium allows the user to create a large bubble around them where time moves more slowly.</dd>
                <dt>Bendalloy</dt>
                <dd>Bendalloy allows the user to create a small bubble around them where time moves more quickly.</dd>
